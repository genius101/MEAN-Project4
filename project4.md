In this project, we would be implementing a web solution based on MEAN stack in AWS Cloud.

MEAN Web stack consists of following components:

- [ ]	MongoDB: (Document database) - Stores and allows to retrieve data.
- [ ]	Express: (Back-end application framework) - Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
- [ ]	Angular: (Front-end application framework) - Handles Client and Server Requests
- [ ]	Node.js: (JavaScript runtime environment) - Accepts requests and displays results to end user

Step 1: Install NodeJs

This would be used in this project to set up the Express routes and AngularJS controllers.

a) Install Node.js on the server by running the following configurations:
- [ ] Update Ubuntu:
- [x] sudo apt update

- [ ] Upgrade Ubuntu:
- [x] sudo apt upgrade

- [ ] Install NodeJS:
- [x] sudo apt install -y nodejs


Step 2: Install MongoDB
