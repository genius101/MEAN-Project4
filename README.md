MEAN Web stack consists of following components:

- [ ]	MongoDB: (Document database) - Stores and allows to retrieve data.
- [ ]	Express: (Back-end application framework) - Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
- [ ]	Angular: (Front-end application framework) - Handles Client and Server Requests
- [ ]	Node.js: (JavaScript runtime environment) - Accepts requests and displays results to end user
